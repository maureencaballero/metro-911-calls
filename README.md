# Metro-E911-Project

"The types of information I would expect to find analyzing this data include:

- A timeline of each storm
Beginning and end of the event
Times of stronger storm impacts, based on call volumes
- The geographic path of the storm generating reports of damage or impact
- Locations of heaviest storm impact based on call volume
- Locations less impacted or not impacted, based on call volume (or lack thereof)
- The types of structures impacted (Residential? Commercial?)
- Communities within the County most impacted by the storms?
- A comparison of the storm paths with areas of the community impacted by Covid today (map available at https://nashville.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=30dd8aa876164e05ad6c0a1726fc77a4)
- A correlation identifying the demographic and economic realities of each community impacted by the storm and to what severity"
